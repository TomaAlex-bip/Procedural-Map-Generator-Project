# Procedural-Map-Generator-Project
Test project for a procedural map generator.

For this project I have followed Sebastian Lague's tutorial series: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3

Currently it's generating only the terrain, but I'm planning to add generators for other objects such as trees, rocks, bushes, grass, and maybe AI controlled creatures.
Also I'm going to fix some issues with the terrain generator, and add water to the terrain.
